# twitter-follower-notifier
This project is a Twitter Follower Notifier that uses an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor Twitter follower name in real-time. When a change in followers is detected, the system triggers a buzzer and RGB LED notification to alert the user. The data is fetched using the Twitter API, with updates occurring every minute.
